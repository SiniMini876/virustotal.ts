# virustotal.ts

A package to communicate with the Virus Total API V3! <br>
I've made this as a hobby and it's a really starter stage so don't expect it to work perfectly.<br>
I had to implement the `VTClient.files.scanFile` method with the v2 api because the v3 api on this endpoint is kinda broken.<br>
Virus Total has a large API endpoints some of which do not work. I have written on top of every method that uses a corrupted API endpoint `// TODO: API Broken`

Make sure you use Node.js version 16.0 > !

To get started look at the `/test/index.js` for the demo. Just follow the [VT docs](https://developers.virustotal.com/)


** I am not affiliated to Virus Total in any way. Make sure you generate a API key through the [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey) website!

Be welcome to modify and improve the code!
